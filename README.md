Web scraping, data analysis, and data visualization of the number of views, distribution of views and number of videos of different countries, video types, US and All Stars seasons, and queens of WowPresents YouTube channels.

## CONCLUSIONS

* This method of analysis provides insights into the distribution of the number of views of different analyst-defined categories of videos on any YouTube channel and allows visual representation of the relationship between number of views and number of videos of different analyst-defined categories of videos.

## TLDR (most interesting insights)

* For video types, queens, countries, US seasons, and All Stars seasons, the number of videos appears visually to correlate at least somewhat with the total number of views, which allows interpretation of trends relative to this visual relationship.
* UNHhhh has a relatively low number of total views compared to the number of videos (and a relatively low distribution of views), which suggests it has a low YouTube audience attraction (even though UNHhhh has the most watched videos on the channel). Further analysis would be beneficial to compare the videos within the UNHhhh series to assess how YouTube audience attraction varies across episodes.
* Fashion photo ruview is the most popular type of video in all All Stars seasons and most of the US seasons, especially since Season 12 (and this type of video has a relatively high distribution of views and a high number of total views compared to the number of videos which suggests it has a high YouTube audience attraction)
* Although videos with Trixie and Katya in the title have a significant amount of videos with their names in the title relative to almost all other queens (almost as many as videos with Raja and Raven in the title), they do not have as high of a number of total views compared to videos with Raja and Raven in the title. This suggests that the videos with Raja and Raven in the title have a higher YouTube audience attraction than videos with Trixie and Katya in the title. Future work could seek to quantify the difference between the number of video-number of views relationship for Raja, Raven, Trixie, and Katya.
* After a low trend in views during Seasons 11 and 12, since US season 13, the distribution of the number of views of US season videos has been increasing (yay)! 
* The UK has a relatively low number of total views compared to the number of videos, which suggests it has a low YouTube audience attraction.
